### 1. In this video -'Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg ', what was the most interesting story or idea for you? ###
#### Answer ####

- Microactions are the tiny, simple steps you take toward building a habit. 
- They are so small that they feel almost effortless, making it easier to start.
- For example, if I want to start writing every morning, instead of setting a goal to write for 15 minutes, I start with a microaction like opening my notebook/notepad and writing just one sentence.
- It’s simple enough that I can easily do it, and once that small habit is established, it naturally grows into a longer writing session.
- This makes building the habit effortless and sustainable over time.
